# Introduction


# Overview

* Property based testing (pure/effect-free programs)
* State machine modelling (monadic/effectful programs)
* Fault injection (provoking exceptions)
* Using the
  [`quickcheck-state-machine`](https://github.com/advancedtelematic/quickcheck-state-machine)
  Haskell library, but the principles are general

---

# Why bother?

* *Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures* paper [@yuan14]

    + "Almost all catastrophic failures (48 in total â€“ 92%) are the result of
      incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signalled in software."

* Fault tolerant (distributed) systems

---

# Recap: property based testing

* Unit tests

```haskell
      test :: Bool
      test = reverse (reverse [1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]

```

* Property based tests

```haskell
      prop :: [Int] -> Bool
      prop xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs
```

. . .

* Proof by (structural) induction

      $\quad\;\forall xs(\textsf{reverse}(\textsf{reverse}(xs)) = xs)$

. . .

* Type theory

```haskell
      proof : forall xs -> reverse (reverse xs) == xs
```

# State machine modelling

---

# The `quickcheck-state-machine` library

* Use abstract state machine to model the program
    - A model datatype, and an initial model
    - A datatype of actions (things that can be happen in the system we are modelling)
    - A transition function that given an action advances the model to the
      next state

* A semantics function that takes an action and runs it against the real system

* Use pre- and post-conditions on the model to make sure that the model agrees
  with reality

* Use QuickCheck's generation to conduct experiments that validate the
  model

# Fault injection 

* Many different tools and libraries, none native to Haskell
* We'll use the C library `libfiu` (**f**ault **i**njection in **u**serspace)
* Two modes of operation
    + Inject POSIX API/syscall failures
    + Inject failures at user specified failpoints

---

# Fault injection: syscall failures

* Using `fiu-run` directly:

```bash
  fiu-run -x -c 'enable name=posix/io/*' ls
```

* Via `fiu-ctrl` in a possibly different process:

```bash
  fiu-run -x top

  fiu-ctrl -c "enable  name=posix/io/oc/open" $(pidof top)
  fiu-ctrl -c "disable name=posix/io/oc/open" $(pidof top)
```

---

# Fault injection: user specified failpoints


```c
size_t free_space() {
        fiu_return_on("no_free_space", 0);

        [code to find out how much free space there is]
        return space;
}

bool file_fits(FILE *fd) {
        if (free_space() < file_size(fd)) {
                return false;
        }
        return true;
}
```

```c
fiu_init();
fiu_enable("no_free_space", 1, NULL, 0);
assert(file_fits("tmpfile") == false);
```
